<title>M.O.G., Behind the Eliezer Yudkowsky door<title>
<text>Steeling yourself, you grasp the handle. <i>Yes, I have acted irrationally</i> you think. <i>Yes, I have made poor
life choices. But what matters is what I choose to do now, not what I have done in the past</i>. As you press down on the handle
and open up the door, a faint feeling of approval washes over you. The engraving of Eliezer appears to be smiling.

Behind the door is a small room, somewhat reminiscent of a classroom.
Rows of desks fill the room, with Gavs of various models sitting at them. Every Gav is writing furiously - the sound of
pen scratching on paper is...well, its not deafening, but its a louder sound than you would ever have thought pen scratching could
make. Next to each desk is a wastepaper basket, filled with crumpled, torn up sheets.

The door <i>clicks</i> shut behind you.<text>
