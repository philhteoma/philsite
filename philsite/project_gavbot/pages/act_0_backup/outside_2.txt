<text>Before you can process your fleeting moment of introspection, an ear shattering GOOOOOOOOOONG pierces the air,
 and gigantic doors swing open. Dozens of previously unseen men and women, dressed in anachronistic formal wear, stream past you
 into the building, all without making a sound. It would appear the days work has begun.

 Then, all of a sudden, you find yourself alone again. It would appear that everyone made it inside. Suddenly, the doors begin to close!<text>
